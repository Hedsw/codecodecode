The basic ideas here:

1.Sort our intervals by starting time.
2. Merge overlapping busy intervals.
3. Find the times between these intervals.
eg. [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
After sort:
[[1,2], [1,3], [4,10], [5,6]]
After merge:
[[1,3], [4,10]]
Now we find the diff. between these using the end time of [i-1] and start time of [i]
[[3, 4]]
